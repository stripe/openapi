Starting with the 2024-09-30.acacia release, Stripe follows a [new API release process](https://stripe.com/blog/introducing-stripes-new-api-release-process) where we release new API versions monthly with no breaking changes. Twice a year, we issue a new release (for example, acacia) that starts with an API version that will have breaking changes.

This folder contains markdown files with changelog entries for the changes that are expected to be shipped as part of the next monthly release.
These are for internal use only.

            its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information
            to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always

            status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason,
            such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`.
            If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to
            `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details

                    invoice](#retrieve_customer_invoice) endpoint. It can also be
                    used to implement custom proration logic, such as prorating by
                    day instead of by second, by providing the time that you wish
                    to use for proration calculations.

                    or a dictionary containing a user's credit card details (with
                    the options shown below). You must provide a source if the customer
                    does not already have a valid source attached, and you are subscribing
                    the customer to be charged automatically for a plan that is not
                    free. Passing `source` will create a new source object, make it
                    the customer default source, and delete the old customer default
                    if one exists. If you want to add an additional source, instead
                    use the [card creation API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_card)
                    to add the card and then the [customer update API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#update_customer)
                    to set it as the default. Whenever you attach a card to a customer,
                    Stripe will automatically validate the card.

                    final amount each billing period. For example, a plan which charges
                    $10/month with a `tax_percent` of 20.0 will charge $12 per invoice.

                    invoice](#retrieve_customer_invoice) endpoint. It can also be
                    used to implement custom proration logic, such as prorating by
                    day instead of by second, by providing the time that you wish
                    to use for proration calculations.

                    or a dictionary containing a user's credit card details (with
                    the options shown below). You must provide a source if the customer
                    does not already have a valid source attached, and you are subscribing
                    the customer to be charged automatically for a plan that is not
                    free. Passing `source` will create a new source object, make it
                    the customer default source, and delete the old customer default
                    if one exists. If you want to add an additional source, instead
                    use the [card creation API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#create_card)
                    to add the card and then the [customer update API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#update_customer)
                    to set it as the default. Whenever you attach a card to a customer,
                    Stripe will automatically validate the card.

                    invoice subtotal that will be calculated and added as tax to the
                    final amount each billing period. For example, a plan which charges
                    $10/month with a `tax_percent` of 20.0 will charge $12 per invoice.
